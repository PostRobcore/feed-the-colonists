This mod allows making 4x kibble and 4x pemmican. The cost of the work is set to be 3.5 X the base amount.

This mod used to also do 4x meals but...

## 🙀 MY MOD GOT EATEN 🙀

I looked into the Defs for RimWorld 1.1 and it looks like creating four stacks of Simple, Fine, Lavish, and Package Survival meals have been added to the base game! I'm surprised!

I have changed this mod as of version 1.2 to only have the recipes for pemmican x4 and kibble x4.

## 🍳 Work Amounts ⏲

### Original Values

|Meal|Work to Make|Skill
|-|-|-
|Pemmican|700|0
|Kibble|450|0

### Mod Values

**Note: Newest version only has pemmican x4 and kibble x4.**

|Meal|Work to Make|Skill
|-|-|-
|4 Pemmicans|2450|0
|4 Kibble|1575|0

## 💻 Can I add it to my game? 📄

Yes, most likely. This mod adds some recipe Defs and RimWorld handles removing and adding them pretty well. The outputs of the recipe are the items from the vanilla game, so this mod is not needed for anything that it produces. It just adds some recipes to some workstations. 😸

## 🕸📄 Can I have an older version of the mod? 📄🕸

Yes! It is available on the Mod DB page!

## 🙌 Thank You 🙌

I first released this mod in 2016 and I can't believe how many people have downloaded it over the years. It absolutely boggles my mind.
