## 💻 Can I add it to my game? 📄

Yes, most likely. This mod adds some recipe Defs and RimWorld handles removing and adding them pretty well. The outputs of the recipe are the items from the vanilla game, so this mod is not needed for anything that it produces. It just adds some recipes to some workstations. 😸

## 🕸📄 Can I have an older version of the mod? 📄🕸

Yes! It is available on the Mod DB page!

## 🙌 Thank You 🙌

I first released this mod in 2016 and I can't believe how many people have downloaded it over the years. It absolutely boggles my mind.
