This mod allows making x4 kibble. The cost of the work is set to be 3.5 times the base amount.

This mod used to also do x4 meals but...

## 🙀 MY MOD GOT EATEN 🙀

I looked into the Defs for RimWorld 1.1 and it looks like creating four stacks of Simple, Fine, Lavish, and Package Survival meals (*and pemmican too*) have been added to the base game! I'm surprised!

I have changed this mod to only fill the missing recipes for 1.1, and fill all recipes for 1.0.

## 🍳 Work Amounts ⏲

### Original Values

|Meal|Work to Make|Skill
|-|-|-
|Simple Meal|300|0
|Fine Meal|450|6
|Lavish Meal|800|8
|Packaged Survival Meal|450|8
|Pemmican|700|0
|Kibble|450|0

### Mod Values

**Note: If you run RimWorld 1.1 or higher, kibble x4 will be added.**

|Meal|Work to Make|Skill
|-|-|-
|4 Simple Meals|1050|0
|4 Fine Meals|1575|6
|4 Lavish Meals|2800|8
|4 Packaged Survival Meals|1575|8
|4 Pemmicans|2450|0
|4 Kibble|1575|0

## 💻 Can I add it to my game in progress? 💻

Yes, most likely. This mod adds some recipe Defs and RimWorld handles removing and adding them pretty well. The outputs of the recipe are the items from the vanilla game, so this mod is not needed for anything that it produces. It just adds some recipes to some workstations. 😸

## 🕸📄 Can I have an older version of the mod? 📄🕸

Yes! It is available on the Mod DB page and in the relaeses here!

## ✨ Future of the Mod ✨

The Feed the Colonists mod will be supported through RimWorld V1.2 then will go unsupported.

I am working on a Feed The Colonists standalone game (yes, really), when I have more information to show I'll post it on my twitter ([@postrobcore](https://twitter.com/postrobcore)) and [my blog](https://postrobcore.net).

## 🙌 Thank You 🙌

I first released this mod in 2016 and I can't believe how many people have downloaded it over the years. It absolutely boggles my mind.

1.2 is the final update for this mod. Please see my blog for a recap of this mod and information on future projects!! 😸
