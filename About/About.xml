  <description>v1.2.3 (final) for Version 1.X!

My mod got eaten by the Core game!

This is the final update for this mod since the main functionality has been absorbed into the game.

I know I'm just the food mod guy, but check out my blog for info on this mod and future projects, including a Feed The Colonists standalone game (yes, really!). I do game development as a hobby and I post prototypes on my site.
