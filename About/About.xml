  <description>v1.2.1 for Version 1.1 and 1.0!\n\nAllows making four stacks of pemmican or kibble. Skill and ingredient requirements are the same, output is 4x default, and the work requirement is 3.5x default.\n\nMy mod got eaten by the Core game! Bulk meals are now in the Core game, so technically this mod feeds colonists and animals in equal amounts. Full x4 meals are available for v1.0.</description>
